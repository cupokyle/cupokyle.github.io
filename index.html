                            The other day my boyfriend told me he wanted to learn to code and I said, <em>"Are you <strong>fucking</strong> kidding me?!"</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>Seriously, I thought he was out of his mind! But then he showed me this test website he designed, and I started to think... "Hmmm... Have I been misjudging my boyfriend all along?" I changed my mind about the blog. What can I say, it's gorgeous! I love him and I hope he proposes to me soon. :-)

                            I truly believe that code is life! Here's why:
                            </p>
                            <p>Think about it. Everything in your life has a code. Nuclear Codes, Pass codes, the list is endless. So I ask you, is code life? Yes!

                            If somebody were to come up to me a week ago and say, <em>"Howie, can you perform a series of incredible Javascript and HTML tasks with <strong>minimal effort?</strong>"</em> I would've said no. But now with the help of <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a>, I have the skills and abilities I need to change the coding world as we know it.
                            </p>
                            <p>Honestly, Mimo has given me the strength to take control of my life in more ways than one. Not only can I create a small calulator that converts grams to kilograms, but I'm also eating healthier, exercising more, and having way more sex with my hot wife. I couldn't have done it without Mimo.
