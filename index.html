                            The other day my boyfriend told me he wanted to learn to code and I said, <em>"Are you <strong>fucking</strong> kidding me?!"</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>Seriously, this guy is insane! But I love him so I have to support him. I love him so much and I want the best for him. I will kiss him constantly and foever lol.

                            If somebody were to come up to me a week ago and say, <em>"Howie, can you perform a series of incredible Javascript and HTML tasks with <strong>minimal effort?</strong>"</em> I would've said no. But now with the help of <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a>, I have the skills and abilities I need to change the coding world as we know it.
                            </p>
                            <p>Honestly, Mimo has given me the strength to take control of my life in more ways than one. Not only can I create a small calulator that converts grams to kilograms, but I'm also eating healthier, exercising more, and having way more sex with my hot wife. I couldn't have done it without Mimo.
